# Swish Plugins

This package contains the builtin plugins for Swish.

## Contributing

If you have ideas of a plugin which would be useful for others but isn't present in the app, or you see a bug in one of the built in plugins, checkout the repo, make a change and create a PR.

Note that there are no specific guidelines for plugins.
Whether a plugin is integrated into the builtin set is up for discussion. Primarily, builtin plugins should:

- Have broad appeal - if you're converting to/from a barely used format it will likely be declined
- Be simple

If you believe an existing inbuilt plugin has limited appeal and should be removed, create a bug for discussion.
